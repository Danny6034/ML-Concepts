# Description

In 1847, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis makes a breakthough discovery: He discovers handwashing. Contaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives.

In this python project I will be reanalyzing the medical data Semmelweis collected. This project explores pandas and I will be using Bootstrap analysis to come to conclusions about the data
